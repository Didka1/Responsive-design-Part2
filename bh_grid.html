                 The fear…that moment when you just want to ran or hide, and sometimes you can do this, but most of the time you shout just stay and wait. Wait for your boss decision, your doctors opinion, yours wife answer, wait till you fell a sleep…You are so tired of waiting, hoping, asking and wanting that you finally wish to run away of yourself.  You just want to be another better person only for one moment. Want to forget you fears and doubts, to be stronger and happier. And the truth is that you can do this….</p>
              <h4 >It is all in your head!</h4>
                 <p>  We all can be better and not for only one radicular short moment.
                     To feel good is not something you just have or you don’t have. It is something to work for. With all this stress and dynamic that we are living in it is normal to think negatively about many things. So to feel psychologically healthy or even good is necessary to practice every day, just like you fitness training for good shape. And no exceptions, even one bad thought can ruin your work.
